# Learning Independent SKills
Task dependent skill transformation is challenging due to the ignorance of the relationships between primitive skills. In this project, we propose a skill decomposition algorithm to learn independent skills, which are more suitable than primitive skills for task dependent skill transformation.


**Required Dependencies:**

_Pytorch_ 1.20

_mujoco_py_ 2.0.2.8

**Visualization of the practical skills for complex tasks:**
